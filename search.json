As a result, the metadata profile is subdivided into modules which are linked through one-to-many relationships. You can learn more about its structure and which information we included, in the documentation of the TerraLID metadata profile.\nThe metadata profile is the foundation for the TerraLID database, from where data can be accessed and downloaded via web application or API.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general structure of the TerraLID metadata profile, highlighting the different modules and their relation to each other.

While the TerraLID Editors already represent a very broad expertise, we are aware that the metadata profile might not be as universally applicable as we intend. Therefore, your feedback and input are invaluable to us and we are very much looking forward to your comments and discussing with you.\nWe prepared a GoogleDoc to collect your comments and will be available for discussion in a series of drop-in calls. All details and the schedule of the drop-in calls can be found on the webpage of the TerraLID metadata profile. We will collect your feedback until 15 October.

The TerraLID project aims to develop the digital research data infrastructure TerraLID, in which lead isotope data are described and stored according to the FAIR principles. As a one-stop portal, TerraLID will also offer options for retrieving, working with, and publishing lead isotope data, and it will develop open educational materials on the method. This project can only succeed if the community is prominently involved in the implementation of TerraLID. Such participation processes already played a central role during in design of TerraLID. During the implementation, the involvement of the community is ensured by a two-stage process in the form of the TerraLID editors as representatives of the community and a public consultation phase. After summarising the development of the project, the various community-oriented formats and processes are presented. Their influence on TerraLID is shown and experiences and insights are discussed. Finally, a comparison with the recommendations of comparable projects shows the successful and effective activation and involvement of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\nCover of Archäologische Informationen volume 47."

The former is tackled by the TerraLID metadata profile, which allows to uniformly describe lead isotope data and their contextual information. The metadata profile uniformly structures the large variety of reported metadata, ensures a consistent level of detail, and guarantees that each metadatum is clearly defined. It resolves ambiguities in, e.g., transliterated site names by using persistent identifiers to augment the information stored in the TerraLID database with metadata records from other data infrastructures. By doing so, the TerraLID metadata profile provides a common ground for reporting lead isotope data and ensures that sufficient contextual information for their reuse. Reporting data according to the metadata profile will make the combination of data from different sources easy, saving a lot of time for individual researchers. In addition, the metadata profile increases transparency and reproducibility of data treatment processes because it eliminates individual decisions in the compilation process of data arising from insufficient definitions and/or only partial overlap of metadata in different data sources."

Data published through TerraLID will experience the same scrutiny to optimally prepare them for re-use independent from their initial research questions and any interpretations derived from them.

Enabling all users to carry out such fine-tuned searches requires access to the database and its content through a well-designed graphical user interface. In addition, intuitively usable tools which enforce a basic level of scientific quality are necessary to enable researchers without in-depth background in lead isotope geochemistry to properly handle the data and to critically assess interpretations based on them. This will be realised through the TerraLID web application as intuitive user interface to the database and collection of the most common tools for handling lead isotope data. For the latter, own data can be temporarily uploaded and the results downloaded together with all necessary additional information (e.g., full reference list, publication-quality plots, important statistical parameters). Open education materials provide a starting point for training in the lead isotope method for everyone new to the method or interested in refreshing their knowledge."

    "text": "Data sharing\nUltimately, TerraLID contributes to changing the academic culture towards open research practices with a particular focus on data sharing practices. This effort is guided by the principle “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. Being machine-generated data, lead isotope data are usually not copyrightable1. Moreover, openly sharing data raises trust in research outcomes because it increases transparency and reproducibility. Moreover, it helps to overcome global disparities in data access. The TerraLID team is nevertheless fully aware that data should sometimes not shared openly because this might, e.g., impact indigenous groups negatively, and these reasons must and will be respected."

Providing the information for the metadata profile will require additional effort compared to current practices and so will feeding data into TerraLID. Therefore, TerraLID will develop intuitive and efficient templates and tools that guide researchers through data entry and it will try to automatically fill in as much information as possible from other sources. Likewise, data integrity checks and data curation workflows will be automated as much as possible to minimise the effort necessary for maintaining TerraLID."

Only then, the authors of the data get appropriate credit for their work (e.g., number of citations) while the impact of TerraLID on the community can be monitored (essential for acquiring future funding). TerraLID will offer convenient ways to properly cite all relevant publications for their data subset by e.g. easy import of reference lists into common reference manager software. On a more general level, the requirement for citation directly clashes with the length restrictions of most publication formats. This is a challenge many research data infrastructures face and technical solutions are currently under development2. TerraLID will adopt them as soon as they are available."

It intends to maximise their findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability, i.e., making the data FAIR with the development of a suitable database while trying to implement the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance as much as possible. A web application provides the interface for submitting, accessing, and working with lead isotope data. In addition, data curation will be minimsed through automated checks and enrichment of metadata from others sources, making it easy to submit data to TerraLID and to maintain it. All other tools will be collected in a software toolbox to make them available to the community outside of TerraLID. Open Educational Resources provide information about all aspects of lead isotope data and their application in archaeology as well as about how to use TerraLID. TerraLID and all materials therein will be made available to the public under open licenses, meaning that software code will be open source, materials open access, and data in the database open access by default with reasonable access restrictions if necessary.\nUltimately, TerraLID aims towards transforming the scientific community in how it handles lead isotope data and to increase the reliability and reproducibility of these data and interpretations derived from them.

The institute teaches about the management of archaeological data in monthly online workshops and in-person summer schools.\nI was able to attend the first summer school in July 2023 at the Badè Museum of Archaeology on the campus of Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, CA (USA). It was a very welcomed opportunity to meet the other participants in person after seeing them via Zoom and to get to know each other in real life. After short presentations of the current state of the participants’ projects, the summer school programme focused on data management plans and linked data.\nIn preparation for the summer school, each project drafted a data management plan (if not already existing) which was then discussed in small groups. This allowed us to get deeper insights into some of the projects and especially how data are handled by them. The feedback provided a lot of helpful suggestions for the revision of the data management plan but also for the project itself.\nLinked data were only briefly touched upon in one of the online workshops and were now discussed in detail: How do they work? What are the benefits? But also, what are the challenges and risks of linked data? Inspiring presentations by the experts and brainstorming sessions on different aspects of linked data led to a much better understanding, many new ideas for the projects and an annotated collection of resources on this topic.\nAlthough everyone was happily busy working on the topics for the workshop, the programme left enough room to get to know each other, discuss our projects in more depth, and get a better understanding of current debates about the handling and preservation of cultural heritage and data gathered from and about it. A tasting of local wines organised by the staff of the Archaeological Research Facility of the University of California Berkeley, a walking tour of the architecture of North Berkeley’s “Holy Hill” neighbourhood, and a great selection of dinner places allowed getting a good impression of Berkeley and its surroundings.\n\n\n\nThe participants of the NADAC summer school in front of the Badè Museum of Archaeology (Photo credit: Alex Roman, used with permission by the NADAC team)"

Known worldwide for its old open cast copper mine and Falun red – the typical red colour of Swedish houses –, Falun gave a very fitting environment for the European archaeometallurgy community to meet and discuss the latest news in the field.\nNumerous presentations and posters informed, among others, about the latest state of the lead isotope method and new approaches on statistical methods and how to combine it with other analytical methods to increase its discriminatory power. The TerraLID team presented the scope and plans for TerraLID as a poster. The conference offered plenty of opportunities to make TerraLID more widely known in the community and to discuss its aims and strategies on how to move forward. Once more, it became clear that an infrastructure for easy access to and standardised documentation of lead isotope data and their context are urgently needed and that the community is full with anticipation for TerraLID.\nThe excellent side programme provided ample opportunities to continue these discussions in a more informal atmosphere and to get acquainted with the rich mining history and beautiful landscape of Dalarnas region. The size and number of slag heaps amidst beautiful forests and lakes around Falun are outstanding and still could give only a glimpse in how profoundly mining impacted the region in the past. After the tours, the white nights and nice bars set the perfect atmosphere to catch-up with friends and colleagues until the early mornings.\nWe were very happy to be part of this well-organised conference and to see that the interest and enthusiasm for TerraLID remained unchanged on a high level.

It further covered software publications and the different types of software licenses. While I was already somewhat familiar with most of the topics, it was just great to get a very well-designed comprehensive overview on this topic and I learned many new additional aspects and gathered important impulses for the work on TerraLID. It was also very encouraging to learn that we already implemented many of the good or best practices in our work on GlobaLID and TerraLID."

The session aimed to bring together colleagues from archaeology, the archaeological sciences and research data management to discuss how to increase the flow of data in the field and promote the use of research data infrastructures.\nIn about half of the presentations, representatives from national research data infrastructures shared their approaches on data management. Another significant part of the session was devoted to material- or method-focused research data infrastructures such as Nomisma.org and ArqueoData. TerraLID was presented as part of the second group. In addition, some contributions discussed more general aspects such as the automated creation of maps optimised for people with colour vision deficiencies or how open anthropological data should be made accessible in an ethically appropriate way. The session was well-received although delays caused by technical difficulties and the overall tight programme left little time for discussion.\nMore than other conferences, the Annual Meeting of the EAA is always a more than welcome opportunity to meet friends and colleagues from all over Europe. As in every year, a personal highlight of the EAA was its social programme with the opening reception at Ex Vigna Barberini on the Palatino and a joyful annual party with a live band performing a selection of well-known Italian and international rock and pop songs from the last decades."

This year, the conference’s main topic was digitalisation and digital services in archaeology. TerraLID was presented as part of the main topic’s programme. The conference provided a welcomed opportunity to get in touch with archaeologists and gaining a good overview about comparable initiatives in Germany, although most of the presentations featured tools and projects focused on data recording during excavations."

    "text": "Young Researchers in Archaeometry (15–18 October 2024, Nicosia)\nThe Young Researchers in Archaeometry workshops are dedicated to early career scientists. Since its first edition in 2017, the workshop marks the first presentation in front of an international audience for many participants. News from GlobaLID/TerraLID was presented already on several editions and was always met with great interest. The workshop is a great opportunity to meet new colleagues and get an impression about the expectations of early career scientists to modern research tools and data infrastructures. It is therefore an important opportunity to learn about how TerraLID meets their expectations and where adjustments might be necessary to ensure that it stays close to the needs and expectations of the community in the future.\nThe local organisers at the Cyprus Institute organised a diverse social programme. Its highlight was undoubtedly the archaeological experiment “Food for the Gods: Sacrificial Pyres in the Archaeological Record”, which aims to reproduce the archaeological remains of pyres. The workshop participants were invited to join the burning of the pyre."

The general idea of TerraLID was met with a lot of interest. However, with very little non-ferrous metallurgical activities in the past, it’s use for local researchers is rather limited. Nevertheless, the conference yielded many insightful conversations about the everyday challenges faced by local colleagues in conducting research. Moreover, it resulted in a lasting impression about the difficulties in establishing and maintaining laboratories dedicated to the archaeological sciences.\nIn addition to the conference, Thomas Rose gave a seminar lecture to the archaeology students of the university, presenting research at the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum and highlighting the potential of scientific methods for understanding past metallurgical processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Rose presenting TerraLID to the conference audience… (photo: Zoila Luz Epossi Ntah-Kroll).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n… his research at the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum to students (photo: Zoila Luz Epossi Ntah-Kroll)."

    "title": "Towards a metadata profile for archaeological materials",
    "section": "",
    "text": "To provide sufficient context about the lead isotope data, TerraLID has to include information about the objects which were sampled for lead isotope analyses. At the same time, this information is not the focus of the TerraLID database. Therefore, TerraLID aims to re-use already existing approaches developed by experts in the respective domains.\nThe IGSN DataCite Archaeology and Cultural Heritage Community of Practice currently implements a metadata profile for archaeological samples. While still under development with a first published version expected during 2025, the TerraLID team recognised a high potential in modeling object metadata according to this metadata profile and therefore decided to join this Community of Practice and to contribute to its development. Most importantly, the metadata profile will be linked to an IGSN, an International Generic Sample Number. IGSNs are persistent identifiers (PIDs) for physical objects, similar to a DOI being a PID for a digital object such as a publication or dataset. This allows easy import of object metadata by its IGSN, analogous to how publication metadata are imported in reference managers from their DOI. In addition, the partnership with DataCite ensures the long-term technical support of IGSNs.\nMoreover, IGSN were originating from the Geosciences for their samples such as rocks or drill cores and the respective Community of Practice already developed best practices for the identification and description of physical objects (i.e., samples). This means that they already offer a metadata profile for the description of ores and other geological materials relevant for TerraLID. Aligning the metadata profiles of both communities is planned when the first version of the metadata profile for archaeological objects is available and will be facilitated by their mapping to the DataCite metadata schema. Because they will use the same technology, this will make it particularly easy to retrieve and include object metadata in TerraLID."

    "title": "Gathering the lead isotope community",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When GlobaLID was announced, there was general enthusiasm for a standardized repository of geological lead isotopic data (ourselves included - no more sharing of excel documents!), but it quickly became clear that such a large endeavor would require a community to operate and maintain. One of the crucial points raised in this initial phase of the database was how to design a system of standards that both ensures its applicability to global contexts, while also integrating with the research of scholars who are already successfully applying the method. Because of these nuances, GlobaLID, in partnership with the Deutsches Bergbau Museum Bochum and the Ruhr University of Bochum, invited scholars from all over the world to a conference in Bochum, Germany in February, 2023 in order to discuss their ideas for creating such a database: from the back-end structure, to establishing standard protocols data evaluation, formatting mechanisms for data submission and tools for interpretation, educational materials, and overall goals of the project.\nBeyond the usual introductions and reconnections, day 1 of the conference was focused on the research of conference participants in order to better understand the variety of ways in which current projects interact with lead isotopic data and databases. These talks seeded an already fertile soil for discussions on how users would interact with the GlobaLID database, how we would approach the issue of standardization, and integrate with the legacy of database creation for archaeologists applying lead isotopic analysis.\nWith the stage set, day 2 of the conference was divided into thematic presentations, focusing on the structure of the database, how to create a standardized platform, and the metadata which should be included. Important to this discussion was an overview of other, already existing, regional databases. GlobaLID’s vision is to create a link which would bind these databases together, integrating the nuance of regional specificity with the broad applicability and reach that a global database affords. Another seminal part of the discussion surrounded the issue of credit and how to ensure that researchers submitting data to GlobaLID would receive recognition for their efforts (and citations in future studies!). As a possible solution to this issue, Kirsten Elger gave an overview of data journals, which can host previously unpublished lead isotopic data with a report of the methods with which they were collected. Publication in these data journals allows the data to be fully citable and will generate a DOI. This ensures that any researcher submitting unpublished data would receive two benefits: 1) a publication that they could list on their CV, and 2) citations of this publication for any study making use of their data. Day 2 also included presentations from Patrick Degryse, Tzilla Eshel, Naama Yahalom-Mack, and Daniel Finn, who collectively summarized the statistical and visualization techniques that scholars routinely employ when evaluating the lead isotopic signature for archaeological artifacts. These presentations served both to discuss current approaches for this practice, as well as select methods that researchers would like to see as available tools on the front-end of the GlobaLID platform.\nUnlike days 1 and 2, day 3 was structured with multiple sessions operating in parallel, to discuss specific topics of interest to participants and establish the overall framework for GlobaLID in component parts. Thematic focus groups included: metadata, standardization, visualization and statistical tools (full programme of the workshop). For these break-out groups, participants outlined important components that should be instituted in each of these thematic topics before re-aggregating for the final discussion. One of the most important developments from these break-out groups was the creation of “regional editors” which are the focus of another blog post.\nWe are two of the regional editors for GlobaLID, and for us, this conference was a great opportunity to meet and interact with colleagues applying lead isotopic analysis to various parts of the global archaeological record. It was also an important moment to set a benchmark for where we, as a community, see lead isotopic analysis going in the future. GlobaLID reflects this vision: it is compatible with the present, but forward looking. The team at GlobaLID is currently implementing points raised during this conference, and hopes to run a follow-up conference in 2025."

In 2022, the community conducted a survey about current practices related to the use of persistent identifiers in archaeology. Since then, activities focused on the development of a metadata profile for archaeological and cultural heritage materials for IGSNs. IGSNs or International Generic Sample Numbers are persistent identifiers for physical objects. Similar to Digital Object Identifiers, or DOIs, for digital objects such as publications, IGSNs make physical samples citable and provide informative metadata about them. This facilitates their (re-)use, improve data sharing and increase the visibility of samples. Because what communities consider as relevant metadata about a sample differs, community-specific metadata profiles for IGSNs are needed for the optimal description of physical objects. TerraLID will align object- and site-related metadata with the metadata profile developed by the IGSN–DataCite Archaeology & Cultural Heritage Community of Practice. This not only allows automatic retrieval of the respective metadata from the IGSN of an archaeological item into TerraLID but also minimises effort if data publication in TerraLID is combined with obtaining IGSNs for the respective samples and objects."
