    "section": "Our aim",
    "text": "Our aim\nTerraLID aims to develop next-generation tools for working with lead isotope data in the archaeological sciences. The primary aim is to create an infrastructure for the submission and provision of lead isotope reference data that makes it easy to submit data to the database, minimises data curation efforts by automatised checks and enrichment of metadata from other sources, and by providing easy access to the data through a web application or the database API. Data will be handled in accordance with the FAIR principles to maximise their findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability.\nDevelopment of this infrastructure is done in close discussion with and active support from the community to ensure that the products are close to the community’s needs. Prototypes of the database and web application were released in 2021 and the project presented to the public in 2022. Implementation of the full infrastructure will start in 2024. The next big step will be the development of a FAIR metadata scheme for lead isotope data in the archaeological sciences. This will not only massively improve the compatibility of lead isotope data but will also serve as data model for the full version of the database. In parallel it is aimed to increase the coverage of the database and to improve the web application.\nBeing an open project, we are always open for new members. If you are interested in helping GlobaLID to develop and make our vision come true, please reach out to the core team via mail (globalid at bergbaumuseum dot de?subject=GlobaLID)."

The offer to participate and exchange ideas was very well received by the up to 40 participants. The aim was to involve the community in the development of TerraLID and to find out what requirements the community has for TerraLID to be able to respond to them specifically in the further development. Thomas Rose presented the TerraLID roadmap in a very vivid presentation and then demonstrated the web app in a simulation. Last but not least, the individual regional editors presented themselves and their work.\nThe meeting was a complete success and there was a lot of positive feedback. It was nice to see how much interest there is in TerraLID from the community.\nIf you missed the kick-off meeting but would have liked to attend,  the recording will become available here soon.\nIf you have any questions and/or comments, please send us an e-mail (terralid at bergbaumuseum dot de).

    "text": "The 6th Archaeometallurgy in Europe conference (11 to 14 June 2024) took place in the old mining town Falun, the capital of Dalarnas region with its picturesque landscape. Known worldwide for its old open cast copper mine and Falun red – the typical red colour of Swedish houses –, Falun gave a very fitting environment for the European archaeometallurgy community to meet and discuss the latest news in the field.\nNumerous presentations and posters informed, among others, about the latest state of the lead isotope method and new approaches on statistical methods and how to combine it with other analytical methods to increase its discriminatory power. The TerraLID team presented the scope and plans for TerraLID as a poster. The conference offered plenty of opportunities to make TerraLID more widely known in the community and to discuss its aims and strategies on how to move forward. Once more, it became clear that an infrastructure for easy access to and standardised documentation of lead isotope data and their context are urgently needed and that the community is full with anticipation for TerraLID.\nThe excellent side programme provided ample opportunities to continue these discussions in a more informal atmosphere and to get acquainted with the rich mining history and beautiful landscape of Dalarnas region. The size and number of slag heaps amidst beautiful forests and lakes around Falun are outstanding and still could give only a glimpse in how profoundly mining impacted the region in the past. After the tours, the white nights and nice bars set the perfect atmosphere to catch-up with friends and colleagues until the early mornings.\nWe were very happy to be part of this well-organised conference and to see that the interest and enthusiasm for TerraLID remained unchanged on a high level. See you next time, 2027 in Granada!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConference participants discussing in front of the TerraLID poster (photo: Thomas Rose).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView from the top of the slag heap with the Lusthus in Österå near Falun (photo: Sabine Klein)."

In practice, they will use their expertise when quality-checking data and metadata from (local) publications concerning the regions they are responsible for, and, with support from contributors, they will add data from their regions to GlobaLID’s database. The Core Team will carry out the final checks of the enriched data before they will become publicly available.\nSo far, six colleagues already joined the GlobaLID Team as Regional Editors:\n\nSoutheast Asia: T.

    "text": "Members of the GlobaLID Core Team are participating in the NEH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities “Networking Archaeological Data and Communities”, a two-year programme of The Alexandria Archive Institute / Open Context. The institute teaches about the management of archaeological data in monthly online workshops and in-person summer schools.\nI was able to attend the first summer school in July 2023 at the Badè Museum of Archaeology on the campus of Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, CA (USA). It was a very welcomed opportunity to meet the other participants in person after seeing them via Zoom and to get to know each other in real life. After short presentations of the current state of the participants’ projects, the summer school programme focused on data management plans and linked data.\nIn preparation for the summer school, each project drafted a data management plan (if not already existing) which was then discussed in small groups. This allowed us to get deeper insights into some of the projects and especially how data are handled by them. The feedback provided a lot of helpful suggestions for the revision of the data management plan but also for the project itself.\nLinked data were only briefly touched upon in one of the online workshops and were now discussed in detail: How do they work? What are the benefits? But also, what are the challenges and risks of linked data? Inspiring presentations by the experts and brainstorming sessions on different aspects of linked data led to a much better understanding, many new ideas for the projects and an annotated collection of resources on this topic.\nAlthough everyone was happily busy working on the topics for the workshop, the programme left enough room to get to know each other, discuss our projects in more depth, and get a better understanding of current debates about the handling and preservation of cultural heritage and data gathered from and about it. A tasting of local wines organised by the staff of the Archaeological Research Facility of the University of California Berkeley, a walking tour of the architecture of North Berkeley’s “Holy Hill” neighbourhood, and a great selection of dinner places allowed getting a good impression of Berkeley and its surroundings.\n\n\n\nThe participants of the NADAC summer school in front of the Badè Museum of Archaeology (Photo credit: Alex Roman, used with permission by the NADAC team)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "When GlobaLID was announced, there was general enthusiasm for a standardized repository of geological lead isotopic data (ourselves included - no more sharing of excel documents!), but it quickly became clear that such a large endeavor would require a community to operate and maintain. One of the crucial points raised in this initial phase of the database was how to design a system of standards that both ensures its applicability to global contexts, while also integrating with the research of scholars who are already successfully applying the method. Because of these nuances, GlobaLID, in partnership with the Deutsches Bergbau Museum Bochum and the Ruhr University of Bochum, invited scholars from all over the world to a conference in Bochum, Germany in February, 2023 in order to discuss their ideas for creating such a database: from the back-end structure, to establishing standard protocols data evaluation, formatting mechanisms for data submission and tools for interpretation, educational materials, and overall goals of the project.\nBeyond the usual introductions and reconnections, day 1 of the conference was focused on the research of conference participants in order to better understand the variety of ways in which current projects interact with lead isotopic data and databases. These talks seeded an already fertile soil for discussions on how users would interact with the GlobaLID database, how we would approach the issue of standardization, and integrate with the legacy of database creation for archaeologists applying lead isotopic analysis.\nWith the stage set, day 2 of the conference was divided into thematic presentations, focusing on the structure of the database, how to create a standardized platform, and the metadata which should be included. Important to this discussion was an overview of other, already existing, regional databases. GlobaLID’s vision is to create a link which would bind these databases together, integrating the nuance of regional specificity with the broad applicability and reach that a global database affords. Another seminal part of the discussion surrounded the issue of credit and how to ensure that researchers submitting data to GlobaLID would receive recognition for their efforts (and citations in future studies!). As a possible solution to this issue, Kirsten Elger gave an overview of data journals, which can host previously unpublished lead isotopic data with a report of the methods with which they were collected. Publication in these data journals allows the data to be fully citable and will generate a DOI. This ensures that any researcher submitting unpublished data would receive two benefits: 1) a publication that they could list on their CV, and 2) citations of this publication for any study making use of their data. Day 2 also included presentations from Patrick Degryse, Tzilla Eshel, Naama Yahalom-Mack, and Daniel Finn, who collectively summarized the statistical and visualization techniques that scholars routinely employ when evaluating the lead isotopic signature for archaeological artifacts. These presentations served both to discuss current approaches for this practice, as well as select methods that researchers would like to see as available tools on the front-end of the GlobaLID platform.\nUnlike days 1 and 2, day 3 was structured with multiple sessions operating in parallel, to discuss specific topics of interest to participants and establish the overall framework for GlobaLID in component parts. Thematic focus groups included: metadata, standardization, visualization and statistical tools (full programme of the workshop). For these break-out groups, participants outlined important components that should be instituted in each of these thematic topics before re-aggregating for the final discussion. One of the most important developments from these break-out groups was the creation of “regional editors” which are the focus of another blog post.\nWe are two of the regional editors for GlobaLID, and for us, this conference was a great opportunity to meet and interact with colleagues applying lead isotopic analysis to various parts of the global archaeological record. It was also an important moment to set a benchmark for where we, as a community, see lead isotopic analysis going in the future. GlobaLID reflects this vision: it is compatible with the present, but forward looking. The team at GlobaLID is currently implementing points raised during this conference, and hopes to run a follow-up conference in 2025."

    "text": "For several months now, the GlobaLID Core Team has been working on “Lead Isotopes in Archaeology: An Interactive Textbook”. The aim is to provide an open educational resource about the lead isotope method and its application in archaeology as a textbook. In contrast to traditional textbooks, the format as a webpage allows the inclusion of interactive content and other multimedia elements. In addition, it makes it easy to update and expand the textbook over time. The textbook is designed as an edited volume to give appropriate credit to all contributors.\nWe are delighted to announce the launch of its first version: https://archmetaldbm.github.io/GlobaLID-Edu/\nThis initial version was supported through an NFDI4Earth Educational Pilot.\nAdmittedly, it is still in the very early stages with only a couple of chapters available but we already wanted to give you an idea about our approach. More chapters will become available in the next months.\nWe are looking forward to your feedback! And please get in touch if you are interested in contributing or writing a chapter – we are happy to collaborate!"
