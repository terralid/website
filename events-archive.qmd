## TerraLID-Community Kick-Off
Thanks to the acquisition of funding in early 2024, the prototypes announced to the community as [GlobaLID](https://archmetaldbm.github.io/Globalid/) will be turned into full versions. This event informed about the development of GlobaLID, the planned activities during the funded phase and the vision of TerraLID. Several [Regional Editors](team.qmd#regional-editors) presented their view on GlobaLID/TerraLID and motivation to contribute. 

Date: 14 May 2024  
Location: Zoom

The recording of the meeting will be available soon.

## Day 2

Round table 1: Which data and meta-information is crucial?

* Introductory talk by I. Villa (Bern): Pb from the millimeter to the planet: what else is usually forgotten?
* Topics:
  a. Analytical data
  b. Geological materials
  c. Artefacts -- and which ones are suitable as reference data?
  d. By-products (e.g., slags, prills, ores from excavation sites)
  
Round table 2: Standardization of databases 

* Introductory talk by K. Elger (Potsdam): t.b.a.
* Topics:
  a. Interconnectivity between different databases: Each group deploys their own data online and develops an API to link other databases. Alternatively, each contributes data to a central database (like GlobaLID) so that all data can be accessed at once?
  b. Unique resource identifier (URI) and controlled vocabularies and terminologies; Adoption of unique identifiers, such as the IGSN for samples. Use of thesauri, ontologies, standardized mineral abbreviations, geological period information from e.g., USGS, EarthChem databases; geological time periods vs. orogenic events. 
  
Round table 3: Statistics and visualization  

* Introductory talk by P. Degryse (Leuven): Perspectives on data dots, biplots, ellipses and model ages
* Additional presentation by T. Eshel (Haifa) and N Yahalom-Mack/D. Finn (Jerusalem)
* Topics:
  a. Visualization, statistic and processing tools, methods -- what is really useful and needed by the community? What is required, what would be nice-to-have?
  b. Reporting -- What is proper reporting? 

## Day 3

9:00--13:00: Morning session

* Impulse talk by Chr. Keller (Berlin): NFDI4Objects
* Presentation of the round table discussions and discussion of their results
* Return to the round tables: Define the discussed standards, taking into account the feedback from the plenary

13:00: Lunch break

14:30 -- 16:00: Afternoon session, final plenary

* Summary of the second round of round tables
* Discussion about how to proceed, e.g., 
  - Follow-up meetings
  - Roadmap to the publication and establishment of the community standard
  - Extension to other methods and materials
  
16:00: Closing of the workshop, take-aways and farewell
