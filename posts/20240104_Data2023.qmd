Thanks to the efforts of our [regional editors](../team.qmd#regional-editors) and the [GlobaLID Core Team](../team.qmd#core-team), the amount of data in the GlobaLID database grew significantly: from 2700 data points at the end of 2022 to more than 4100 data points. Our spatial coverage also increased with data from Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. You can find a full list of countries for which data were added on the News page of the [web application](https://globalid.dmt-lb.de/). 

More data is currently reviewed and prepared â€“ stay tuned!
