Version 1.1 of the GlobaLID database is now published at GFZ Data Services under its DOI [10.5880/fidgeo.2023.043](https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2023.043). 

This version contains the 2255 new data points added since the publication of [version 1.0]( http://doi.org/10.5880/FIDGEO.2021.031) and extends the metadata included in the database. Most importantly, the analytical uncertainties of the Pb isotope ratios can now be included, as well as the mineralisation style and whether the Pb isotope datum was measured on a sample from a deposit relevant for archaeological research. 

See a full list of the changes in the [changelog of the version 1.1 data description](https://datapub.gfz-potsdam.de/download/10.5880.FIDGEO.2023.043-NcaeIBF/GlobaLID_Data_Description_v1-1.pdf).
