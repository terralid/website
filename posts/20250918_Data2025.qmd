A new archived and citable version of the database is now available ([doi:10.5880/fidgeo.2025.080](https://doi.org/10.5880/fidgeo.2025.080). Thanks to the efforts of our [regional editors](../team.qmd#regional-editors) and the [GlobaLID Core Team](../team.qmd#core-team), the amount of data in the GlobaLID database continues to grow. The new archived version represents the state in August 2025, with more than 5700 data points. Since our [last update](20250305_Data2025.qmd), we further increased coverage for many regions. Compared to the previous archived version, the growth is even more impressive with more than 1500 new data points and increased consistency in the metadata of many existing ones. You can find a full list of countries for which data were added on the News page of the [web application](https://globalid.dmt-lb.de/). 

More data is currently reviewed and prepared – stay tuned!
