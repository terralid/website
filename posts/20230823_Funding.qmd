We are excited to announce that GlobaLID received a major grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG; German Research Foundation) for a three-year digital infrastructure project to turn the prototypes into a full version. The project will start in February 2024 and will include many opportunities for you to provide feedback and input to ensure that GlobaLID will meet your needs and expectations. In the major work packages, we will continue to work on 

* An online database that stores lead isotope data in accordance with the FAIR principles, enhanced by workflows for the publication and curation of the data
* A metadata scheme to provide sufficient context to the lead isotope data in a well-structured way
*	A web application to access and work with the database and to carry out common tasks when working with lead isotope data
*	An interactive textbook as a collection of open educational resources about all aspects of the lead isotope method
*	Bringing the lead isotope community closer together and providing training through workshops 

More information will become available in early 2024 – stay tuned!
